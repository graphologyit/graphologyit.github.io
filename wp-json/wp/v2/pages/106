The intensity of this need is given by the degree of total graphic slant: a slight slant creates a need for sentiment to establish emotional ties which are entirely under control. But when the slant reaches 45&deg; degrees (7\/10 of the sign) affectivity enters into languor and then into abandonment, becoming in this way a disintegrating sign because &quot;it places Self&#39;s weakness where strength and sacrifice should be. It can therefore damage all the qualities.&quot; (Moretti, 1962, p. 16)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 6 &#8211; Forward Slant of over 7\/10<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting036.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: forward slant of over 7\/10\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting036.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: forward slant of over 7\/10\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> &nbsp;The Forward Slant is the sign of sentiment which roams freely in search of an object on which to lavish its affection, its languid affectivity, in order to associate its own personality with that of another; it is the sign of the art of attracting, of laying snares, of the &quot;ability of expression that hits the mark&quot;, of the &quot;ease of access to important people in order to obtain a favour&quot;. (Moretti, 1968, p. 13) From an intellectual point of view, the Forward Slant tends towards assimilation. &quot;The reason is that, being the affectivity of abandonment, it receives the blow and does not react, letting affectivity pervade it and incorporating what has been thrown at it: and then when having to produce, it does not have the creative force because this depends on reaction instead, but it has the force of assimilation.&quot; (Moretti, 1972, p. 488) <\/p>\n<p> It is a sign that has paranormal tendencies in affectivity, in that by placing itself in a relationship of assimilation with other personalities, it is also necessarily attuned to the desires, worries and moods of those people subject to its partiality or dislike.<br \/> The affectivity of the Forward Slant, seen in all the expressions of languid affection, takes forms of altruism, while in reality it satisfies the need for the subject to associate his own personality with that of others. In this sense, it leads to a strong need for consideration that must be satisfied in many ways: an obsession for giving advice, interfering in other peoples&#39; business, and wanting everything to go absolutely according to its own point of view. The Forward Slant gives the pretension of being understood and supported, with an insistence which, in the long term, can become very difficult to bear for those who become the object of such attention.<br \/> In any case, those who have the Forward Slant sign love being involved in all emotional complications, they feel comfortable in difficult relationships because they love to torment and be tormented, in that accusations, arguments and emotional blackmail feed their need to always be in an emotional relationship with someone.<br \/> The Forward Slant sign indicates the tendency to lie for at least two different reasons: intellectually it indicates &quot;the assimilation tendency which attempts to disguise with features of originality&quot; (Moretti, 1974, p. 276); emotionally it shows behaviour marked by altruism, while in reality it tends towards self-satisfaction.<br \/> It shows direct disposition for trade and business &quot;precisely because they are acts of lying in order to manipulate business strategies in such a way as to let the intention to follow the client&#39;s interest emerge&quot;. (Moretti, 1962, p. 129)<br \/> According to Moretti the Forward Slant sign of 7\/10 or above contains many elements of disequilibrium:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the subject is dominated by feelings of partiality and dislike and is not able, therefore, to express objective judgements;<\/li>\n<li>the habitual mood of languor makes the individual weak and in need of support and the tendency to support others (where it feels affection) leads to surrender by abandonment;<\/li>\n<li>consequently intelligence is very easily influenced;<\/li>\n<li>the decrease, practically the extinction, of its own personality due to the assimilation of the personalities of others enters directly into a type of hysteria understood in its broadest sense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, the Forward Slant sign also indicates a certain &quot;anomaly in the division of mine from yours&quot;, in that it tends to favour itself and those for who it feels partiality and affectivity. In the search for its own profit, it can be unjust to the point that it takes possession of that of others.<br \/> As we can see, it is a very complex sign and it has a great impact for the personality in the higher degrees. However, the psychological context in which it is realised always needs to be understood.<br \/> For example, the meaning of &#39;surrender&#39; that coexists alongside the complete inflexibility of the sign must always be correctly understood: the individual supports itself in order to assimilate, and in this its tendency has an extraordinary force due to the constancy in satisfying this tendency, which is vital for its survival. The coexistence of the two characteristics which are apparently contradictory can appear clear only to those who have experienced the sign in action in some way.<br \/> Furthermore, the psychological meaning of assimilation at a degree equal to (7\/10) is greatly strengthened if it appears in rather technical writings, while it softens and leads to original assimilation in the event of graphic contexts characterised by greater vivacity (Methodically uneven, Rushing, Profuse &#8230;)<br \/> Even the level of psychological pressure exercised by the Forward Slant sign on others, still at a degree equal to (7\/10), changes significantly based on the graphic context in which it is expressed: signs exist that strengthen the tendency to satisfy the pretensions of the emotional sentiment (A Angles, B Angles, Straight extensions, Narrow spacing between letters&hellip;), belonging to the Forward Slant sign, but the same sign can also be realised in a context that leads towards a greater overall liberality (Large spacing between letters).<br \/> Despite the fact that the Forward Slant sign is one of the most simple Morettian signs in its direct impact on the personality, the graphic context in which it is realised must be carefully considered for the above average values, in order to understand the sign&#39;s overall &#39;tolerability&#39; in interpersonal and above all family relationships.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&quot;A sign which is of a more psychic than neuromuscular nature.
