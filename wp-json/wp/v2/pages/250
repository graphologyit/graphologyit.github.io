As individuality, personalization, uniqueness characterize all issues in life, according to Moretti\u00a0 such a sign cannot fully exist in reality, because \u201cThe sign Even itself is not suitable for human beings, as man does not stand out as a species but also and mainly as an individual. Now, the sign Even is a sign of copy totally devoid of personality, therefore an individual cannot be such.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 (19)<\/p>\n<p>If the sign Even is spontaneous, in a quite fluid setting, it suggests a personality with very little need for individuation. As Methodically Uneven is the sign of inner restlessness, typical of people trying to give expression to their unique essence, the sign Even, on the contrary, is the sign suggesting a higher ability to keep a low profile and adapt to external conditions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 13  &#8211;  Writing homogeneous in size, in a setting of spontaneous expression<br \/>\n<a title=\"Handwriting: Homogeneous in size\" href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting081.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting081.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Handwriting: Homogeneous in size\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 14 &#8211;   Even writing in a setting of slow execution<br \/>\n<a title=\"Handwriting: Even\" href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting082.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting082.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Handwriting: Even\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This sign suggests aptitude for learning and communicating what was learned without personal interpretation; generally, it gives the personality an aptitude for accounting executive tasks. In fact, necessarily people with Even, having no ability for invention and original interpretation, tend to sheer reproduction of exterior, more consolidated issues of everything they focus their attention on.<\/p>\n<p>From an aptitudinal point of view, ability in reproduction may extend to all fields, including art; in such case, however, coldness may be more clearly perceived because feeling lacks of vivacity and intense expressivity. Moreover, the sign Even with Fluid entails a capacity to deal with people in trade. As a matter of fact, it is clear that \u201cMethodically Uneven does not give such an ability, because dealing with the public implies some steadiness in action, which is not among the skills of Methodically Uneven.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 (20)<br \/>\nFrom a psychological point of view, this sign can be spontaneous, that is really an indication of a scarcely differentiated personality; however, this sign can also be a consequence of a reactive formation, when it is put to use as a control, resulting from the personality need to set strict rules both to its inner world and the external environment; this\u00a0 in order to set up a shield against a living condition perceived as dangerous, uncertain, vague or too emotionally charged. In such case, the sign Even looks stiff, marked, as a result of an incremental enhancing of the sign Accurate.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 15  &#8211;  Even handwriting due to enhancing of the sign Accurate<br \/>\n<a title=\"Handwriting: Even\" href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting083.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting083.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Handwriting: Even\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>From a psychological point of view, it is clear that such a difference is crucially important: if the inclination to Even is spontaneous, such personality should not be urged to face too complex situations or challenges, because an intuitive potential would be needed and it is not available to Even.<\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, if such graphic automatism is the result of a reactive formation, it is necessary to identify the stressor that led this personality to strongly reinforce its defence mechanisms based on a search for rules to abide by, to the detriment of its capacity to connect to the present moment intuitively. The stress on external, standard rules cannot but imply, with time, a repression of spontaneous behavior and a detachment from the sensation of inner bounty which only to be in touch with one\u2019s own uniqueness can give. Hence, such graphological combination must be necessarily considered a warning and the situation which led the Ego to build such inner jail as a defence -against sensations perceived as excessively destabilizing-should be identified.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In order to belong to the graphological concept \u201cEven\u201d, a writing must show not only a marked homogeneity in the size of minor capital letters, but also a lack of variations in slant in a setting of high precision.
