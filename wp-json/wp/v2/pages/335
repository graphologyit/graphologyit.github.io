Such an empirical evidence questions us about the search of a possible cause-effect relationship: is it either a drug the cause of a fragmented personality, or a fragmented personality implies a stronger tendency to become addicted?<\/p>\n<p>In order to frame addiction as a problem to be solved, using a perspective wider than Day Hospital\u2019s, it becomes necessary to explore a graphological\u00a0 context larger than common addicts population, referring to the \u201ccultural\u201d inspirers to the use of drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Starting from the Beat Generation main figures implies referring to perfectly conscious theorists, in a sense that the use of each kind of drug had been set inside a wider aim: the exploration of the conscious mind structure, in order to\u00a0 expand it. Such a research was not only psychological but religious too, as Kerouac answered the journalist\u00a0 about what he was seeking for so desperately: \u201c<em>I used to answer\u2026 I was waiting for God to show\u00a0 his face.<\/em>\u201d (1)<\/p>\n<p>This search for expansion of the mind-seen not as rational consciousness but as a widening of subjective experience itself, that could possibly disclose cognitive revelations-affected many artists, who in turn exerted a similar influence upon the younger generations.<\/p>\n<p>About this questioning, we are going to start from a basic remark: obviously not all drug users became addicts, whilst people with the sign Disconnected become strongly addicted to drugs with a much higher frequency. Hence, what was firstly seen as a means of making easier and richer the interactions between personality and the outer world becomes instead the nightmare of addiction: personality becomes totally enslaved to something totally alien, affecting all its movements. From a strong need for lavishness and freedom to obsession and repetition.<\/p>\n<p>Kerouac and Ginsberg, two personalities we are going to analyze now, are especially interesting because, even though both artists owe a lot of their inspiration to the use of any kind of drug, one of them was totally engulfed to a point of being totally and painfully isolated from society and also paranoid (Kerouac), while the other one made it a resource, keeping a steady capacity to relate with the world to the very end of his life (Ginsberg).<\/p>\n<p>From a graphological point of view, this is a striking evidence of what reported by social workers and assistants: Kerouac\u2019s handwriting is strongly characterized by the sign Disconnected; on the contrary, Ginsberg shows a high degree of the sign Disconnected.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A psychologist and a social worker, both working with drug users in two different institutions, pointed out\u00a0 that drug addicts\u2019 handwriting is characterized -with an impressive frequency- by the use of capital letters, that is by the sign Disconnected.
