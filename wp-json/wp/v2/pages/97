Having to go into the profundity of things is right for those who have the power and tendency and this belongs to the Tiny handwriting; but the fact of wanting to deepen the same profundity by finding particulars that are irrelevant or to put forward questions that are in themselves out of place, or enrich its own knowledge with a culture that lies completely beyond the tasks that it has, or expect the pedantic observance of minute details, rules, assessments that are manifest to everyone, all this belongs to meticulous. Therefore the meticulous places itself under arduous exertion by not ever managing to perform the tasks that fall to it; for this reason it redoubles work hours and neglects necessary rest, in such a way that it is impossible that it does not fall into mental exhaustion thus making its mental faculties pathological. They are types that are subject to scruples of conscience. They are not fit for pedagogical applications or for the direction of souls because they stop on the minute details ignoring the substance &hellip;. They do not know how to enter into the mental and moral necessities of an individual &#8230;&quot; (Moretti, 1972, p. 223)<br \/> The Meticulous sign, precisely due to the many notions that it is able to accumulate, feels a certain intellectual superiority of its own, that can give rise to that attitude called conceit.<br \/> The Meticulous, partaking in the same psychological exaggeration of the Tiny sign (&quot;too many particulars, overly refined observation&quot;), and lacking in profundity and spontaneity, is that which it pays the highest price in terms of interior disequilibrium, since it is directly subject to mental exhaustion, because &quot;it is not ever satisfied with what it has understood or concluded. So its occupation and anxiety (more exhausting than the occupation) are excessive and cannot but suck up the comprehension faculties indefinitely and cause exhaustion.&quot; (Moretti, 1962, p. 134-135)<br \/> &quot;In itself it is an indicator of disintegration because it hampers and prevents the natural course of things, therefore it damages the qualities that need spontaneity and openness and freedom of mind.&quot; (Moretti, 1962, p. 17)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The small size can be damaged in a thousand ways by excessive delay on the observation of particulars, and this is perceivable graphologically by the presence of jerkiness, disconnections, slowness, hesitancies, snagging, etc. But the small size&#39;s tendency to detailed observation can also be penalised by a mind that is not open and profound enough [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":94,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/97"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=97"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/97\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/94"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=97"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
