Actually, creativity does not belong to the mind or the heart, but it appears in those magic moments when the powerful forces of reasoning, motivation and inspiration work jointly inside the self and blend together so that the contribute of one cannot be distinguished from the other\u2019s. this is the sign of art and inventive (not demonstrative) science, as both root into a common ability: intuitive intelligence, which possesses \u201c<em>the power of noticing the deep relationships between things<\/em>.\u201d (8) \u201c<em>Intuitive people with a mere sight embraces a whole combination of things and flies to conclusion. But if asked about slightest details, he can explain everything<\/em>.\u201d (9)<\/p>\n<p>Hence, the inventive tendency linked to the sign Methodically Uneven can be employed both in the scientific and artistic field, as original intuition is a common root: that is, the ability to grasp the endless variations that shape life and the capacity to grasp the deep relationships (laws or ordering principles) ruling the movements which belong to life itself. As told above, it is an ability of intelligence which makes use of a sensory and perceptional data set and processes them according to highly complex frames in order to make subjective experience-perceived as problematic- understandable, by improving control and adaptation skills. However, the actual application field for any intuitive intelligence is highly personal, responding to the most specific interests belonging to any personal history (motivations); besides, it is related to the aptitudes coming from the whole personality evaluation. What makes the difference between inclination to art or science is mainly the sign Spacing between Words, as an intelligence highly endowed with critical and reasoning skills (Spacing between letters above average) is also irresistibly attracted to everything related to demonstrative rigor and formal logic processes. Therefore, though the sign Spacing between Words itself is not necessary to a single scientific finding, as this one can live only on the power of the intuitive mind, such sign becomes essential when a single finding, to be acknowledged as \u201cscientific finding\u201d, must overturn consolidated scientific theories or formulate a new one ex novo.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 7 \u2013 C.

Such tendency itself has nothing to do with envy for others\u2019 successes.<\/p>\n<p>The stronger the sign, the more intense such need becomes, bringing restlessness and a discontented attitude until the person can find the precise shade he is looking for. As we are talking about original intelligence and feeling, the unique shade belonging to the self is something to be found not only inside but, at the same time, created outside. Hence, such process does not take place easily.<\/p>\n<p>The sign Methodically Uneven can be already present at a high level  in the first years of primary school.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 9 \u2013 The sign Methodically Uneven in childhood<br \/>\n<a title=\"Handwriting: Methodically Uneven in childhood\" href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting077.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting077.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Handwriting: Methodically Uneven in childhood\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>About people showing this characteristic Moretti writes: \u201cThey are people who develop their intelligence by means of observation, as they are totally estranged from reproduction. As children, they almost look not very intelligent, because they get into life little by little, with manifestations consistent with their age. A talkative boy is often considered intelligent, but is not. Such ones (with Methodically Uneven) instinctively perceive if topics are unsuitable to their age and avoid them. All statements made by grown people are assessed inside and kept under observation by these children, till understood in depth; but they are in no hurry to get to a solution.\u201d (10)<\/p>\n<p>This sign is a direct measure of substantial essentiality (conceptual intelligence) and direct truthfulness; however, it should be considered that \u201cPeople with methodical unevenness shrinks from lie, but is very good at lying and does it whenever somebody tried to take advantage of his truthfulness, shrewdness, penetration.\u201d (11) It should be also considered that no respect to the strong need for independence typical of Methodically Uneven always causes direct opposition, contradiction or open rebellion.<\/p>\n<p>More specific vocational suggestions, in addition to the signs found in the handwriting, come  also from an evaluation of size variations.<\/p>\n<p>When the writing is more calm and the continuous unevenness between letters is less evident (\u201cas it is visible but not evident\u201d), the Methodically Uneven sign, defined as \u201cfirst kind\u201d, becomes also measure of an inclination toward art regarding \u201c<em>sophisticated lyric poetry, satire, painting, miniature and also sculpture<\/em>\u201d (12).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 10 \u2013 Methodically Uneven, 1st kind<br \/>\n<a title=\"Handwriting: Methodically Uneven\" href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting078.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting078.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Handwriting: Methodically Uneven\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When the writing is more dynamic and continuous variations between letters are more visible, the sign Methodically Uneven becomes measure of inclination towards organization, which, to be effective \u201cneeds impulse and dynamism, to get full control of all his work, to simplify everything as his work were already concluded. The organizer tends to see clearly his conclusion and sees the route to do in the very same concept of organization itself. \u201d ( 13)  In this case, it belongs also to the sign Rushing.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 11 \u2013 Methodically Uneven, 2nd kind\u00a0 (Le Corbusier)<br \/>\n<a title=\"Handwriting: Methodically Uneven\" href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting079.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting079.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Handwriting: Methodically Uneven\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An aptitude for science is placed between the two ends above considered, because a scientist needs both some calmness to realize long term research and organization skills to convey efforts, research, experiments toward the direction perceived as fruitful.<\/p>\n<p>If the sign Methodically Uneven is not widespread, originality is not supported by a continuous source and can be replaced by reminiscences.<\/p>\n<p>If unevenness becomes excessive, the writing does not belong to \u201cmethodical\u201d style and is defined \u201cRandomly Uneven\u201d or \u201cDisorderly\u201d.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Though the systematic or methodical handwriting variation may deal mainly with graphical dimensions, usually a sign is defined by size variation measured especially in the minor lower case letters.
