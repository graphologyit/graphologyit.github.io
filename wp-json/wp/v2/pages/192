The graphological sign Heavy (or Marked)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Whenever handwriting is characterized by a marked pressure spread all about the trace, i. e. in the ascending traits too, it belongs to the sign Heavy or Marked.<br \/>\nFrom a psychological point of view, a marked use of physical strength belongs to a personality which loves contrasts, which appreciates clear and precise positions undisturbed by interpretative undertones, which understands evidence if only demonstrated in the material plan.<br \/>\nIn the polar opposition matter\/spirit Heavy belongs to the former, as it owns not only the strength to act in order to remove material obstacles but it also loves the process of manifestation in the physical plan.<br \/>\nHowever, a personality characterized by the sign Heavy, being quite insensitive to the flowing of subtle energies, can stride across life like a caterpillar: where a tiny breath of wind is enough, it uses a hammer anyhow. Moreover, as it considers as real only ultimate effects, it finally believes only in them, which are instead the final step of a much longer process. Thus, the individual is kept as a prisoner of the most material level of reality, which becomes excessively polarized in an exterior sense, losing any power of influencing subtle currents of energy. Personality, though it does not realize it, imposes gradually its \u201cobjective\u201d criteria as the only worth of being considered, ending by being the master of its own world, no matter wide or narrow, exerting a marked imposition without realizing its nature, as, subjectively, it perceives it as \u201cneuter\u201d: other people are too sensitive, and feel hurt because of trifles. Therefore, it ends in such a blindness such as to cause an even more dramatic collapse, because underground reality is endlessly changing, while perception is insensitive to subtle signals: consequently, change can take place only by means of disruptive, exterior events.<br \/>\nIn poorly differentiated graphic contexts, especially whenever graphic marking affects too much the fluidity of the handwriting (Fluid below average), the sign Heavy is a sign of a heavy materialism, thus of a not very evolved psyche, both from an intellectual and emotional point of view. In more differentiated graphic contexts, where some vivacity is present, this sign \u201c&#8230; suggests an intelligence which goes to the substantial in things and strongly holds onto it, with no danger for the individual to be influenced by his adversary\u2019s oratory, as the heaviness of the hand suggests a personality not refined nor delicate, therefore good at concluding&#8230;\u201d (Att, 229)<br \/>\nAs already pointed out describing the sign Filiform, Heavy does neither indicate directly altruism nor selfishness, but only a tendency to materialism in feeling; for instance, it does not admit delicacy and sophistication, but tenderness can be present. Therefore, love is not easily perceived in its idealistic sense, but refers directly to sexual issues. Even though well-meaning, those who exhibit the sign Heavy become quite often freezing when expressing themself because they lack delicacy, as they do not discriminate at the inner subtle sensitivity level.<br \/>\nInterpreting this sign, it is important to check both graphic context and evolutionary differences, as this sign may indicate not only materialism in feeling but also strong tension due to ongoing conflicts, revealed by the use of physical strength on the self in order to avoid being invaded by inner currents perceived as dangerous. For instance, young women prefer to utilize the sign Accurate as a defensive force, sometimes together with the sign Heavy. As a result, such a handwriting is rigid, heavy, representing an exterior appearance as a fa\u00e7ade the young woman is showing to the world. In men, marking occurs with a similar defensive function in a subsequent evolutionary step, in contexts showing more visibly an inner inquietude.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whenever handwriting is characterized by a marked pressure spread all about the trace, i. e. in the ascending traits too, it belongs to the sign Heavy or Marked.
