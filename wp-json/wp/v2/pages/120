Moreover, the extreme specialization of some functions can make it harder to adapt himself about other areas of life. Actually, for this reason it was universally thought that a person gifted with exceptional creativity, the so-called &ldquo;genius&rdquo;, could find it very difficult to lead an ordinary life and adapt himself to it.<br \/> In Einstein&rsquo;s case, his geniality is not as intense as to cause a difficult adaptation. On the contrary, surely graphic homogeneity and fluidity are themselves highly balancing factors: intellectually and emotionally this subject seeks the right measure. He does it intuitively, spontaneously and very efficiently. Einstein&rsquo;s handwriting reveals exactly the contrary of what we could imagine about a &ldquo;genius&rdquo;: we are not dealing with exceptional qualities which hardly fit in ordinary lifestyle, but, on the contrary, his remarkable tendency to balance, to a right measure, keeps him, instinctively, away from situations which could elicit too strong reactions, therefore from debauchery, sometimes associated with &ldquo;genius&rdquo;. He has got no resources to ride such waves.<br \/> In fact, graphologically, the perfect balance which enables him to master fully his intellectual resources in order to employ them in mathematical elaboration comes also from the lack of many psychological qualities. First of all, &ldquo;Sinuous&rdquo; is not present; as it represents the capability of perceiving others&rsquo; moral and psychic conditions and to see deeply into them, it is also the first limitation in Einstein&rsquo;s personality. There is no skill of resonating, through insinuation, with somebody else&rsquo;s soul, hence is also missing the main instrument of understanding individuals in their psychological situation. Second, the calm that characterizes him does not come from a hard-fought, thoughtful control, but otherwise is the consequence of a lack of vivacity in feelings, which do not show any extrovertive nor empathic elans. Feelings are also somehow conventional as, like intelligence, lack of intuitive originality.<br \/> Hence, Einstein&rsquo;s feelings widely founded on his qualities of goodness, generosity, full balance, lacks of the capability of vibrating on the somehow complex, well-articulated notes of the endless-for him, foolish-variety of human expressions. His regularity finds it hard to understand a need for irregularity, the nourishment this can also provide. Whilst he would wish for a paternal relationship made of learned, quiet, and slightly detached conversations, about which he feels perfectly qualified, ha does not know a language to relate to these &ldquo;strange&rdquo; children who fell to his lot, hence he feel painfully speechless and impotent.<br \/> Einstein protected instinctively his cut-off point about his inner resonance, keeping friendly, rational, learned emotionally detached relationships not to stir his inner balance, and he possessed the clearmindedness to understand completely also this facet of his personality. (7). He cannot ride the emotional waves his children represented, as they mercilessly reveal- unwillingly- his being inadequate as a father. Einstein must rationalize such a pain, such inability: therefore he has to persuade himself that his son&rsquo;s hostility depended on his mother who set him against his father (he never allowed himself to feel the pain of the child abandoned by his father, and what&rsquo;s more, the pain of the child for his mother, abandoned by his father); he must tell his friends that his second son is mentally insane because he inherited his mother&rsquo;s folly. What&rsquo;s important, it is to negate and keep away from himself any responsibility or emotional involvement, not because in Einstein&rsquo;s handwriting were present a vein of cruelty or selfishness, but because of an emotional impairment he cannot redeem. Simply, he cannot live powerful, passionate human feelings; the load of emotions which upset the mind are facets of the human life that Einstein declines, to which he says: no, thanks.<br \/> He refuses to be overwhelmed by the folly of the mass media which would like to change him into a star, throwing him defenseless to the everchanging moods of the crowds. He also rejects-for the same reasons- to get in touch with the upset world of his highly intelligent younger son, to the point of behaving-objectively-in a very cruel, pitiless way, simply keeping him out of his sight, far enough to be in another continent.<br \/> As Jung pointed out, we all can manage our main function very well, whatever it is. But how painful whenever the part of us we have no idea about how to relate with is touched, even lightly.<br \/> Einstein can bear all projections the media throw on him, through his extraordinary inner balance and all exaggerations slip over him leaving no trace. The whole world, when he died, was ready to forge a sanctuary around his grave and he decided to be cremated and have his ashes scattered by the wind instead. We endlessly admire such a man, so in control of himself to refuse being put over and above everybody.<br \/> It is hard to be understood that the very same qualities which allowed him keeping his balance in the face of flattery made him so cruel to his children.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a well-structured system, what is helpful about a field can become a disadvantage about another one.
