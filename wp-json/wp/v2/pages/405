Therefore, we are talking about a psychological disposition which, to be sure, does not belong to everybody. For this reason Moretti makes it very clear that, whenever the sign does not show at the highest level, it loses its main meaning.<br \/>\nThe sign Stable on the line graphologically requires two points:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> The writing should go on an horizontal line, not ascending nor descending;<\/li>\n<li>The writing should keep the same axial direction in all letters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 6<br \/>\n<a title=\"Handwriting: Stable On The Line\" href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting093.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting093.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Handwriting: Stable On The Line\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Therefore, in order to score this sign at the highest degree, a perfect horizontal baseline of the writing, excluding \u2013 for instance &#8211; the wavering on the line that belongs to the sign Hesitant, is not enough; it has to be also psychologically reinforced by a homogeneous axial inclination of letters. Why such a support is needed?<\/p>\n<p>Willpower, says Moretti, moves horizontally because obstacles are pushed away horizontally and it shows a homogeneous inclination because it does not wave inside himself about its decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Firmness, which psychologically differs from tenacity (B Angles) and inflexibility (Straight Extensions), implies mastering of any situation coming from inner strength, which can face any confrontation, and not from stubbornness or inflexible attachment. It reminds us of a logical process led through both strong and weak points of the whole personality. Such a combination exhibits a thoughtful look, no preferences.<\/p>\n<p>The handwriting in Fig. 6 shows a really admirable, perfect horizontal line: it does not show the highest degree of the sign Stable on the Line due to the slight sinuosity characterizing the letter axes (Stable on the Line 9\/10). Therefore, such a personality finds it very difficult to let go and relax, but because of its psychological understanding, can do it almost unwillingly.<\/p>\n<p>The handwriting shown below (Fig. 7), though belonging to a resistance temperament (Spacing between Words + Tiny), on the contrary suggests a personality endlessly questioned by the Ego (Hesitant on the Line, Sinuous\/Twisted, Impatient); for this reason, it cannot show firmness \u2013 which is a calm, full mastering of its own mental and psychic functions \u2013 but inquietude and dissatisfaction which can lead the individual to destroy today what was yesterday an important part of his\/her identity, in an evolutionary process much harder, but coming anyhow to an end.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 7<br \/>\n<a title=\"Handwriting: Stable On The Line\" href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting094.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting094.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Handwriting: Stable On The Line\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The graphological sign Stable on the Line is really charming, as clearly such an inner resource can give the personality a special skill in conveying all its power in a homogeneous, integrated movement, to proceed without that energy dispersion that arises from an inner doubt or from a wavering due to indecision. But if considering the limits of the individual Ego, and consequently the limits of the personality which uses such unyielding firmness, it can be easily understood how dangerous such bright quality can become, when pushed to the extreme.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, when present at the highest degree (Stable on the line 9-10\/10), such firmness can exceed in imposing its view on others. For this reason Moretti points out how \u201c<em>the sign Stable on the Line, though suggesting firmness of mind, at the highest level becomes a sign of a firmness lacking objectivity<\/em>\u201d (T, 106).<\/p>\n<p>Firmness is a wonderful quality to express a personality, but whenever the Ego is going through those moments of deep reorganization, due to different reasons &#8211; which unavoidably every personality has to come through in a lifetime &#8211; letting go to make room for something new ( not yet identified)\u00a0 becomes a real torture.<\/p>\n<p>It is also clear that having the highest degree of this sign implies less psychological intuition (Sinuous) and every kind of intuition creates some dishomogeneity, both in the line and inclination ( it should be remembered that a perfectly homogeneous inclination belongs also to the technique of the sign Parallel). Therefore, a personality proceeds, in the best case, with an extraordinary determination unsupported by subtle intuitive sensitivity, but above all, by logical chain\u00a0 reasoning, making the sign Stable on the Line \u2013 and this emerges from practice \u2013 almost indissolubly bond to the sign Connected.<\/p>\n<p>The sign Stable on the Line, just because of this favored use of logical thinking, is connected to the global mind potential belonging to the personality given the fact that firmness, though always logical, can be sometimes totally unreasonable. Moretti himself, for instance, noticed that when the triple width is below average \u201cfirmness would make unshakable things that cannot be so\u201d, whilst with a triple width above average and well\u2013balanced \u201c<em>we see those superior beings who can rule, cannot forget justice, can consider the different social situations, both in community and individuals; and chose to be ruled by a courage which can sometimes break, but not bend <\/em>.\u201d (Att, 57)<\/p>\n<p>Unshakable firmness is actually the one that breaks, not bends, the one which examined thoroughly everything and for this very same reason finds it almost impossible to let go of something, unless it finds other logical reasons to widen its view.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It could be said that most people write keeping quite steady on the line: this statistical remark can suggest us a psychological consideration: this sign, index of firmness and strength of mind, is psychologically significant &#8211; that is, a differentiating factor in personality evaluation &#8211; only if present at a very high level (8\/10), because [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":403,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/405"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=405"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/405\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":434,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/405\/revisions\/434"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/403"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=405"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
