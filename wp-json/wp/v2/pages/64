We are only apparently dealing with three different personality characteristics in that, in reality, they originate from a common movement.<br \/> Moretti saw in the space that we leave between one letter and another the way in which we relate with something that is outside of us, the psychological space that we concede to others. This space, interpreted analogically, corresponds to the openness of sentiment towards that which is outside itself and it is this openness that, when differently quantified, appears in its different aspects interpretable as generosity, justice and avarice. It means almost gathering the mental breathing of the handwriting, that produces important differences at personality level.<\/p>\n<p>The impulse, expansion, spontaneous affectivity and warm welcoming movement belong to generous sentiment (Fig. 4). Generosity, however, does not belong to justice because it does not objectively observe who is in need, but responds to those who present themselves with the guise of greater need, since it lets itself be attracted by what strikes sentiment &#39;here and now&#39;.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 4<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting014.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting014.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fairness (Fig. 5) requires a more attentive, even mental, control of the expansive movement, since an evaluation regarding the objective necessities, not only sentimental, of those who give and those who receive must be implemented. It favours, therefore, the search for the right action without unjustified openings and without closures.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Fig. 5<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting015.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting015.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> Whereas the fear of being deprived of what is regarded as vital for the Self&#39;s survival (Fig. 6), whether it is emotional, mental or material, brings an excessive narrowing of the relationship movement with that which is outside of us, thus entailing displays of avarice. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 6<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting016.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting016.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These three different methods of explanation of the relationship sentiment have direct and important repercussions at the intellectual level since generosity is a disposition of sentiment not only to the liberality of giving, but it brings with it also the aptitude to comprehension for broad-mindedness; the tendency to justice, for itself, requires a greater control of the circumstances to keep itself in objectivity; the tendency of the avarice sentiment, that expresses the fear of Self being deprived of that which belongs to it, also imposes itself on intelligence which becomes narrow-minded owing to the inability to recognise the value of that which doesn&#39;t belong to it.<br \/> The Morettian graphological sign &#39;Spacing between letters&#39;, direct quantitative indicator of sentiment&#39;s tendency to the level of expansion, is one of the easiest to measure and assess in reality because it is exactly as it appears and the mathematical measurement corresponds to the psychological value, without the contextual interpretative precautions that are usually used and that make graphology so difficult.<br \/> Measuring the sign starts from the average value of the letter width: if, between one letter and another within a word there is a space equivalent to the average letter width (although in this case it would be more exact to use the statistical term &#39;mode&#39;), the sign will have the value of 5\/10, a direct indicator of sentiment&#39;s disposition to justice; if the space between one letter and another corresponds to two average letters, it would have a gradation of 10\/10, while all the other gradations are calculated accordingly.<br \/> In Morettian psychology the tendency to fairness (&#39;Spacing between letters&#39; of around 5\/10) is, from the intellectual and emotional point of view, that which makes the personality more balanced. The more it diverges from the sign&#39;s average gradation the more difficult it becomes to obtain its own ends, as liberality and prodigality involve the dispersion of powers, while avarice makes it more difficult to reach the objectives due to the excessive containment of the resources utilised.<br \/> The above-average &#39;Spacing between letters&#39; sign reaches psychologically significant values already at 6\/10, as it is an indicator of the disposition to kindness in the evaluation of others&#39; works. When the gradations move above 7\/10 heartfelt compassion comes into play which distracts from the necessary severity to act in reality; this means that generosity of sentiment leads to the acknowledgement not only too many excuses for itself and others, but it also distracts from the focus on the possible causes that have generated particular effects. Therefore, the personality marked by generosity shows great capacity to establish friendly relationships, even those of a passionate nature, but has difficulty building over time because it tends to scatter energies in too many directions, overrating its ability to resolve intricate situations using the enthusiasm of the moment.<br \/> The 4\/10 &#39;Spacing between letters&#39; sign involves the aptitude for tasks of nearly mathematical precision, since sentiment starts to be contaminated by a certain subjective interpretation, by a restrictive severity that does not belong to objectivity, but to the narrowness of the point of view of the person watching. A fairly self-centred sentiment is subject to forms of touchiness when it is irritated due to a lack of broadmindedness. From 3\/10 and under the sign becomes an indicator of a sentiment heavily marked by forms of material, emotional and intellectual avarice. In particular Moretti sees, in the accentuated narrowness between the letters, the true indicator of sophistry, as a form of intellectual avarice. Sophistry, in this sense, is nothing but the splitting of hairs in the conduct of others, due to the stinginess of intelligence which originates in the narrowness of sentiment that imposes its pretensions and fears.<\/p>\n<p>The Spacing between letters sign is a sign that can remain constant for life or reflect profound changes linked to evolutional or involutional stages of personality. In particular, we note that below-average values can appear during difficult moments in life as Self&#39;s defensive methods. In the example shown the subject maintains constant spacing for over nearly 20 years, from the age of 26 (Fig. 7) to 43 (Fig. 8). The critical phase connected with the separation from his wife (Fig. 9) denotes the need to reinforce Self&#39;s boundaries in order to maintain the ability to go through this moment defending his own point of view by means of a distinct reduction of the liberality that has always marked him.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Fig. 7 &#8211; 1981<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting017.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting017.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<li>Fig. 8 &#8211; 1998<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting018.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting018.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<li>Fig. 9 &#8211; 2001<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting019.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting019.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Moreover, narrowness between letters is frequent in young women&#39;s writing, as compensation for the excess of openness in the &#39;Letter width&#39; sign (Fig. 10): in this context the two signs are in reciprocal opposition, in order to prevent that the comprehension of the reasons of others (above-average Width of letters) leads to a surrender that can injure the integrity of Self, which as yet is felt as too weak.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 10<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting020.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting020.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: spacing between letters\" \/><\/a> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The &#39;Spacing between letters&#39; sign takes three possible fundamental dispositions of sentiment into consideration: the tendency towards expansion seen as generosity, the tendency to restraint seen as a requirement of fairness, the tendency towards contraction seen as avarice.
