Therefore, Marx in many ways made his own life a sacrifice for his believings\u2019 sake.<br \/>\nHowever, his winning point was the wide theoretical system called \u201cscientific socialism\u201d, based on his firm belief, shared by his followers, that his dialectical view of the class struggle were a totally objective analysis of economy laws which, when clearly appointed, could give scientific previsions of the future; not only, they could also affect the course of history itself, by increasing the rate of a revolutionary process that he considered, anyhow, unavoidable. This because future cannot &#8211; in his view &#8211; be arbitrary, but must respond in an expected way, if its hidden laws have been understood and studied deeply enough.<br \/>\nFrom this apparently very strict view stemmed Marx\u2019s contempt for all the socialist\/communist\/anarchist theorists of the time, because he considered them utopist and sentimental since they didn\u2019t analyze, as he did, the historical process in progress from an exclusively materialistic viewpoint.<br \/>\nActually, Marx couldn\u2019t admit he was himself deeply animated by his idealistic vision of a classless and exploitmentless new world which would finally ransom man from his chains. He allowed himself to follow this aspiration of his heart just because \u201chistorically\u201d unavoidable and \u201cscientifically\u201d demonstrated, therefore not delusory. (And here comes all the persuasion of highly focused men, who consider feelings unreliable, dangerous, finally insubstantial).<br \/>\nStrangely enough, Marx, nowadays totally repudiated by left wingers as an embarrassing memory of past failures, lately has been reconsidered by some of his adversaries, the \u201cmean\u201d capitalist, who cannot but find flattering the passionate, famous description he made of the glorious deeds of this class <em>\u201cthe bourgeoisie&#8230;revealed the power of human activity. It created pieces of work more admirable than Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts and Gothic cathedrals, it led much more difficult expeditions than migrations of people and crusades.\u201d \u201cThough its class supremacy lasted for only one century, the bourgeoisie generated productive forces more numerous and vast than the ones created by all past generations. Subduing of natural forces, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam navigation, railways, electric telegraph, tilling of whole parts of the earth surface, rivers navigation, whole populations such as they were suddenly born from the earth-which past century could ever imagine that in the womb of social work could be hidden such productive forces? \u201d<\/em> (6)<br \/>\nAnd, far-sightedly, Marx could even foresee the globalization process presently taking place: <em>\u201cThe bourgeoisie&#8230;made cosmopolite both production and consumption in all countries. (&#8230;) Instead of the old-time self-sufficiency and local and national isolation, an universal trade takes place, an universal mutual dependency among nations. And as it happens for the material production, so it does for the intellectual one. The intellectual creations of the individual countries become common heritage. Unilaterality and narrow-mindedness of a nation become more and more impossible, whereas a world literature develops from the different national and local literatures. \u201d<\/em> (6)<br \/>\nThis said in an historical time when the process of formation of the individual nations was not concluded yet.<br \/>\nIn October 1997 a \u201cNew Yorker\u201d \u2019s special issue declared Marx \u201cthe next great thinker\u201d, a man who can teach us much as for political corruption, monopolistic tendencies, alienation, global markets. At least, a great, bright scholar of capitalism.<br \/>\nCourses and recourses of history are really unpredictable!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>THE POWER OF A METICULOUS MIND It may be inquired why, in the wide, colourful landscape of 1800\u2019s revolutionaries, actually just Marx could be singled out as a formal representative of the social revenge of the poor, as an icon giving inspiration in the hard, intense process of social change characterizing the world in the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":114,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/153"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=153"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/153\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/114"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=153"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
