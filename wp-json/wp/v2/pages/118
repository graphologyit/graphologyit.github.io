The light of intellect"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting040.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: Albert Einstein\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting040.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: Albert Einstein\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Actually against the common opinion, Moretti never ascribed to Einstein the label of &ldquo;genius&rdquo;, because, in spite of his many intellectual qualities, he did not show a visible &ldquo;Methodically Uneven&rdquo; in his handwriting, which is the token of an inner unending originality and creativity, both necessary to identify a &ldquo;genius&rdquo;. Einstein, as many pointed out already, was creative only during a part of his life, corresponding to his first marriage&rsquo;s, and only in that time. Afterwards he did not yield anything significant anymore, on the contrary he did not fully understand the developments in quantum physics, which he criticized. Let&rsquo;s see his intellectual resources from a graphological point of view.<br \/> Evaluating the individual intellectual potential by means of Moretti&rsquo;s graphological system means first of all, estimating the value of the triple width and its balancing, and from this point of view Einstein&rsquo;s handwriting appears well supported: we are dealing with a deep intelligence (Letter width), therefore capable of understanding the various facets of complex problems; generous (Spacing between letters), hence open to the findings of other minds; characterized by a graphic distinction (Spacing between words to an average value) enabling to evaluate clearly others&rsquo; ideas. But not to criticize others&rsquo; ideas, because he has not any proneness nor power to it.<br \/> His strong intelligence is supported by a spontaneous proneness to be clear and calm, what allows his mental power to develop completely, unaffected by haste or emotional contaminations, hence capable of carrying out an action in full respect of the investigated issue.<br \/> A firm and resolute personality, as shown by &ldquo;Stable on the line&rdquo;, depending not only on the perfect straightness of the latter, but also on a steady and homogeneous slant of the letters. A remarkable firmness in this personality is also enhanced by a proneness to be tenacious (B Angles), necessary to hang on any interesting issue, yet clearmindedly, as such angles are widespread but not too marked.<br \/> His handwriting is characterized by the sign &ldquo;Fluid&rdquo; with a high score, that is spontaneity and confidence in thinking and speaking, which all together give him creativity in thought. &ldquo;Fluid&rdquo; is the sign characterized by adaptability of feeling about any interesting issue: he is gifted with responsivity, which spontaneously activates attention and memory; it brings along the tendency to unify, reconcile, homogenize heterogeneous means, simplify.<br \/> Just because of this, Moretti made &ldquo;Fluid&rdquo; one of the main signs suggesting sensitivity of feeling, meant as a capability to relate to the outer world. Being natural and spontaneous does not get along well with efforts: intuitively, such people find a way to overcome obstacles and let go of useless tensions.<br \/> Therefore, as the typical signs of intuitive assimilation are dominant, intellectually Einstein appears a processor of others&rsquo; principia he could guess and unify in a formal expression, but starting from already given components. Then, graphologically, a great processor, not a genius. This Morettian view seems to agree with all those-like E. H. Walzer- who state that &ldquo;those whimsical main ideas which gave way to relativity&rsquo;s great turn&rdquo; came from Mileva Maric, whilst &ldquo;the general formal expression of the theory&rdquo; were Einstein&rsquo;s. (6)<br \/> His gift for mathematics is confirmed by the triple width&rsquo;s homogeneity and by the overall graphic clearness, even though &ldquo;Essential&rdquo; is not very strong. This sign, suggesting laconicity, whenever not present to the highest degree, as in Einstein&rsquo;s case, takes along exhaustion producing fatigue in the application of pure mathematics.<br \/> Graphic homogeneity, suggesting firmness, gives him steadiness in his tendencies and interests, control of instinct and emotional life, through the regularity of expression: if I decide to sleep for 8 hours, I shall sleep for 8 hours; if I decide to keep studying for 8 hours, I shall be able, because there are no perturbing inner stimuli to distract my attention from my goal. It may be easily understood how this one must be the first requirement for a speculative, abstract science like mathematics.<br \/> Clearness and spontaneous accuracy reinforce the above. These are accessory, not substantial qualities, but necessary whenever there is some matter to stabilize furtherly a personality regarding those namesake signs.<br \/> Einstein had no interest in experimental application, as he found it intriguing by the speculative point of view. Graphologically, however, homogeneity and fluidity granted him fecundity, syncretism, easiness in performing about several areas, but not original inventions nor concepts. But homogeneity and clearness, his strong points as a mathematician, at the same time could have been the cause of the weak facets in his emotional life. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Actually against the common opinion, Moretti never ascribed to Einstein the label of &ldquo;genius&rdquo;, because, in spite of his many intellectual qualities, he did not show a visible &ldquo;Methodically Uneven&rdquo; in his handwriting, which is the token of an inner unending originality and creativity, both necessary to identify a &ldquo;genius&rdquo;.
