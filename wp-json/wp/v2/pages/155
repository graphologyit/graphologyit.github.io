Whereas methodically unevenness, in addition to directly suggesting an original way of thinking and feeling, furthermore it enhances his perceived dissatisfaction, restlessness and his totally and completely independent initiative, as he must express himself wholly, without any adaptation.<br \/>\nIn addition to these two signs, there is a strong emotional component in his personality (Off-and-on carved II) reinforcing the restlessness and intensity of his reactions, taking lucidity away \u2013 at the very moment of reaction &#8211; from his mind, already very unquiet.<br \/>\nTo make even more complicated this personality outline, there is also, evidently, a strong difficulty to lead thinking to its conclusion, both because of his \u2013 subjective &#8211; inner indecision (Hesitant, Wavering) and because his critical thinking is, objectively, a little unbalanced (strong dishomogeneity in Spacing between Words), as his reasoning goes on intermittently, to the point of being sometimes hypercritical, some other times absolutely instinctive.<br \/>\nThis graphological combination between a very small size and signs of subjective unsureness (Hesitant, Wavering) causes his deep, rich observation (Tiny) to stumble over his meticulousness; owing to an inner indecision, his mind is never satisfied with all it collected, though very accurately seeking all the facts, situations, extenuating and aggravating circumstances, because it feels unsure of its conclusions.<br \/>\nTherefore, he proceeds with his mental investigation, furtherly deepening its observation, finding in this process satisfaction to his need of a detailed analysis of reality, willing to see in depth all details, even though negligible, of his investigation object, but finding also, at the same time, the exhaustion of somebody who cannot combine together the increasing mass of collected observations.<br \/>\nThis complex picture ought to be furtherly enriched with the analysis of defensive mechanisms that, directly and indirectly, his personality employs: in this handwriting is not missing the sign Curved and \u2013 unexpectedly &#8211; there are also extensions which are concave on the right side, clearly showing that sometimes Marx could be good and \u201csubmissive\u201d; still, his personality is well defended by his difficult mind (Tiny, Meticulous), by a further tendency to contradiction due to the sign Backward Slant, reinforced by the intensity of the sign Twisted, suggesting a strong tendency to control everything. Clearly, both Backward Slant and Twisted enhance his drive to contradict and rebel.<br \/>\nFinally, Rising confirms the urge of his feeling to end wherever it wants, with some kind of conceit coming also from the impossibility of a direct comparison on the field of reality.<br \/>\nThe graphological sign Dark, due here to a marked unevenness and a total absence of graphical precision, reminds us of how hard he found to reconcile his intense world of intuitions with his need to express them in the strict logic an clear exposition he demanded from himself.<br \/>\nBecause this exactly Marx expected from himself; all his reasoning had to have the very same objectivity of a scientific progress, and that was really hard to be obtained, given his impetuous, passionate, emotional personality, still indecisive at the same time.<br \/>\nThe inner pressure he exerted on himself whenever he had to write in a proposing &#8211; and not dissenting style &#8211; rebounded violently on his physical wellbeing, and that he knew very well.<br \/>\nFor instance, Marx was perfectly aware of how much it costed him to write just the first book of \u201cThe Capital\u201d as for somatizations, in addition to the 20 years of his lifetime; his other books were published by Engels after Marx\u2019s death, reorganizing his notes\u2019 thousands of pages.<br \/>\nIn his personality, the strong need for the observation of reality (Tiny, Meticulous) and originality of his intuitions (high Methodically uneven)- somehow- join together in a fertile combination to an unending enrichment, therefore these two functions support each other in an endless bidding upper and upper; nonetheless, they are also each other\u2019s obstacle, as this personality is never satisfied with all it could collect, because it cannot ever come to conclusions good enough to calm it down, to satisfy it; that is, to say: yes, I worked so hard, but now this is what I gathered.<br \/>\nThis is never possible for Marx, because his handwriting is strongly characterized by signs of subjective insecurity, hence he is absolutely certain only of what he does not want for himself. His mind employs exceptional instruments (detailed, original observation) to defeat his opponents, therefore he can come to some conclusion just by riding a contradiction\u2019s wave. He is also, like Freud, an intelligence based on negation: exceptionally capable of finding faults in the others\u2019 thinking, nonetheless exerting so much in the effort to build a theoretical proposing system. This happens because he lacks ponderation, clearmindedness and inner quiet.<br \/>\nHis theoretical system originates from opposition: as his personality is especially sensitive to contradiction (Tiny, Meticulous, Methodically uneven, Backward Slant, Twisted, Off-and-on carved II), this is just the trigger which allows his thinking to materialize in certain &#8211; at last &#8211; conclusions.<br \/>\nStruggle is what allows him to define exactly what he is not, and in such a way he begins to define what he could be. His whole inner world, extremely rich in ideas, but always needing further in-depth study, unable to reach any conclusion about any topic, suddenly, by means of this struggle comes to a flowing life, to self-defining ideas which proceed like a river in flood and resolve the stagnation condition, the impasse where his mind tends to pause because of its exceeding meticulousness (Tiny + Wavering).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No need to consult a graphologist to identify in this handwriting a dreadful inner restlessness, the very inability to live in a regular stable situation, because each thought, each moment requires something new that must be caught an revealed.
