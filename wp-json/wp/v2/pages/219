This is the art of manipulation, of discrimination, \u201cof  sorting in order to select what is necessary according to necessity and opportunity\u201d (T, 85). Of course these are necessity and opportunity settled according to the level of consciousness reached hitherto by the Ego, consequently it is a highly defensive sign; however, such defence is so subtle that it may be hardly noticed.<\/p>\n<p>This sign\u2019s importance is such that its high frequency &#8211; as in Swami Rama\u2019s handwriting &#8211; makes a personality unsuited \u2013for instance &#8211; to science, because being too strongly inclined to manipulation, though finely and subtly performed, it tends to play with facts and people \u201cby excessive scheming\u201d. That is, objectivity is rejected, as the hard facts devoided of any embellishment or decoration, facts not simplified nor clearly defined for good, but still available to further transformation. For this reason, Swami Rama\u2019s handwriting reveals a perfectly balanced personality, but inclined to outsmart as C Angles \u201calways implies deceit somehow, though deceit may be only subjective, that is it may consist just  of the art of making acceptable every hard truth\u201d . (Att, 31-32)<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, at first such graphological diagnosis may seem preposterous, but entering this bright\u2019s personage using such a key can make us understand and appreciate him much better in his glory and substantiality.<\/p>\n<p>First, his personality is characterized by a perfectly balanced mind (triple width), more and more interesting  because he did not loose with time passing- the way it often happens- his vivacious and original reasoning and feeling, enriched also with high introspection (Sinuous).<\/p>\n<p>Enough to think about one of the steps of his spiritual initiation-spending eleven months locked in a small dark cave with just a little hole in the ceiling a glimmer of light passed through- in order to help him in focusing on a single spot (sic!).<\/p>\n<p>Swami Rama says through such a practice in this period of time \u201cEven the laziest aspirant will achieve Truth.\u201d. It could be said instead: everybody with a minimum mental disturbance and who did not learn perfectly such spiritual practices or not totally persuaded in choosing this path for him\/herself, would be dropped through natural selection automatically. Only the strongest, the most determined will be left; actually, those who have learned much discipline, but also have acquired inner richness as well.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Swami Rama\u2019s story, told in his book My life with the Himalayan masters is a little masterpiece of unending psychological prowess. Every chapter  celebrates his joy to be dipped in an universe rich in psychological games he grasps very subtly, due to his triple combination of the signs Methodically uneven (originality), Sinuous (psychological intuition) and C Angles (savoir faire). In the beautiful dialogues with his master he reported, he plays with roles, so that his beloved master is always the one to give wise and deep answers to Swami Rama\u2019s always silly questions. But it becomes evident how deep a knowledge his master had about this youth\u2019s abilities, to a point he was chosen to be sent to the U.S. in order to establish one of the bridges between West and East, built in a high number last century. It also becomes evident the master\u2019s subtle psychological leading on him, as his master understood both the restlessness and the attraction young people always feel toward the external world and allowed him to ride it in order to become not a prude proceeding by negation but a wise man, evolving by understanding.<\/p>\n<p>Still interesting is to know that his manipulation prowess and grace was such that he could control his body as he liked, as proven by scientists who performed several experiment on him in a laboratory, therefore as strictly as necessary to Western science.<\/p>\n<p>However, still a proneness to manipulation is present, though artistic, though linked to the purpose of serving God, but anyhow sign of an inclination to a full control of the Ego on anything it takes in and receives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swami Rama\u2019s handwriting &#8211; that we can consider extremely rich in substantial qualities &#8211; evidently shows a graphological sign the writer would not ever expect in a mystic\u2019s writing: the sign C Angles with highly above average values (at least 8\/10).
