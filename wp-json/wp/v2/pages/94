Considering that the tendency of the small size to careful and detailed observation is not understood in an exterior and static sense (as it could be by the signs Clear-Accurate), but is a function of control and defence that flows directly to the intellect, the more defined its own vision of reality appears to be, the less is the margin available for reconciliation and negotiation during the moment of social interaction. The self is aware of what it has seen in all its particulars and it must consider these in its depiction of the world. This means that the smaller the size, the more numerous are the particulars focused on and the greater is the mental effort necessary to unify them in a coherent and united vision that allows the self to act with knowledge of cause.<\/p>\n<p>The small size does not feel the weariness of focusing, which is a necessity, a function that the mind exercises spontaneously and with the pleasure of expression of that which belongs to it. In this it enters into &#8216;taste&#8217;, as Moretti defines it, that it does not provoke weariness because it contains the pleasure of pausing in the observation of particulars.<br \/>\nBut personality may not be able to manage the quantitative aspect of the function. In the positive aspect the small size collects, manages and unifies an enormous quantity of observations and can process them in a unique, extremely sophisticated and profound system of interpretation of reality. This is the small size defined by Moretti as the graphological sign &#8216;Tiny&#8217;, which is to say accompanied by handwriting fluidity and profundity of intelligence.<br \/>\nBut in the negative aspect, the quantity of information gathered creates a situation of stalemate: the system is overburdened without the capacity to coordinate, with the consequent mental shattering into an infinite series of small disconnected observations without a united vision. It is that which Moretti defines as the graphological sign &#8216;Meticulous&#8217;, which is to say the small size without smoothness and intellectual profundity.<\/p>\n<p>Moretti treats the two signs totally independently. Nevertheless it is important to understand the common psychological origin, since in reality the small size does not always show itself as so clearly divisible into Tiny or Meticulous, but often the two signs coexist creating composite realities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When the measurement of the average letter body goes below 2 mm, we enter into the small sized handwriting which allows the identification of defences in the personality implemented by means of a marked intensification of the faculty to observe reality: while the large size tones down, the small size is the graphological indicator of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":87,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/94"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/94\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/87"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
