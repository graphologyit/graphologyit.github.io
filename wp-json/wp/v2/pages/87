On one side there is the need to reach external reality through the recognition of how the world appears, in order to then process the data into a framework which is logical and useful for the protection of Self. In this activity the personality exercises a function of environment control and recalls the principle of reality assumed by Freud. On the other, there is the need to bend the world to its own needs and desires, because the world also exists to nourish and gratify the Self (the principle of pleasure that must also be satisfied).<br \/> The concept of handwriting size as a graphological indicator of the disposition to equilibrium between the mental function of recognition of reality&#39;s needs and the Self&#39;s satisfaction impulse, originates from the meeting of these two powerful impulses present within the personality, both of extreme importance for the psyche&#39;s equilibrium.<br \/> It is very difficult to reach the symbolic significance of this disposition of the psyche by starting from its medium value: often, at a psychological level, we only manage to understand the equilibrium of a function thanks to the observation of situations in which a disequilibrium of the opposites is present.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 1 &#8211; large size<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting026.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: large size\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting026.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: large size\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>LARGE SIZE<\/strong>, meaning handwriting of 5 mm and over in the average letter body, reveals that the equilibrium between the two opposites is split in favour of the centrifugal force of Self&#39;s expansion, which is preferred at the expense of observing reality. The individual is dominated by the desire for freedom of action, he does not want to confront reality too often leaving himself the freedom to exaggerate as much as he wants according to the needs of Self. In this sense it is an indicator of megalomania and of verbal constructions which do not have solid foundations.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 2 &#8211; small size<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting027.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: small size\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting027.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: small size\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>SMALL SIZE<\/strong> (under 2 mm), on the contrary, splits the equilibrium in favour of an intensification of the centripetal force, constituted by a mental concentration that observes all and takes account of everything, even from a defensive point of view: it is a game of reality control carried out by means of careful observation of all the particulars. It becomes extremely demanding for the psyche since it enters into the function&#39;s automatism, which is to say it is applied all the time and everywhere, even in situations that do not require it, such as for example, emotional situations, creating a sense of distance and social isolation due to the overburdening of mental activity.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fig. 3 &#8211; medium size<br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting028.jpg\" title=\"Handwriting sample: medium size\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.graphology.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/handwriting028.thumbnail.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Handwriting sample: medium size\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Lastly, <strong>MEDIUM SIZE<\/strong> (2-3 mm) represents the equilibrium of the two tendencies, but an equilibrium that in order to be understood requires firstly analysing the extreme polarities.
