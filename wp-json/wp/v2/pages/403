However, the Morettian view is much more subtle, as it considers the specific way the writing keeps the line, comparing it to all the graphological indexes present in handwritings.<\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking, the analogical interpretation rule is as follows: the integrated basic movement is the graphological sign Stable on the Line, a sign of individual psychic steadiness, that is, of the inner strength of the writer. It implies \u201c<em>a disposition to keep feelings invariable in their substance, without depriving them of their liveliness and richness: it is the foundation of constancy.<\/em>\u201d (Sc. 4-5)<br \/>\nThis basic movement may be present with different importance, but it may also differentiate in two movements, different from itself: Rising on the Line represents excessive strength, that becomes enthusiasm, fervor which may imply a claim to knowledge, to action, to obtaining; Descending writing is a sign of lacking firmness caused by moral or physical weakness, therefore a disposition to despair, to become depressed when confronting troubles or effort.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it is time to analyze in detail the psychological implications linked to the basic interpretation rule.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Generally speaking, being able to keep a straight-on-the line handwriting \u2013 without being supported by a line below \u2013 is, first of all, a sign of good health and sufficient physical strength.
