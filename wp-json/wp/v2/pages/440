As Moretti says, people with the sign Essential at a high degree \u201cdo not tend to outbursts, because they always take a pause between cause and effect\u201d\u00a0 (T, 201). Moreover, his handwriting is very plain: he always chooses the simplest way to get to his goal and this comes from a conclusive and process logic also belonging to the sign Essential. His well-balanced triple width above average enhances the sign Essential, further emphasizing that for Newman all in the world must be objective matter, not appearance; that results in demanding mental sorting work\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 due to a very strong disposition to the observation of reality in the cleanest possible way.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, a man devoid of megalomania, but sympathetic thanks to a seeing and understanding glance on humans, on their strong and weak points.<\/p>\n<p>Butch Cassidy\u2019s character fits him perfectly, 100%, as he plays himself, his good nature, his subtle sense of humor which is not biting nor judging (Curve, well-balanced triple width); his leadership power comes just from having a superior mind and not from the need to rule people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>His well balanced widths, the sign Essential at a high degree with Methodically Uneven also very marked and a widespread sinuosity can explain us his understanding glance, both essential and, at the same time, highly original.
