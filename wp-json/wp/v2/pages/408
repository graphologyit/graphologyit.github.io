Moretti, Graphology Treaty)<\/p>\n<p>The psychological meaning ranges from the mere ardor, understood as a fervor, as a disposition to improve in a specific field (5\/10 of the sign Rising) to a tendency to conceit (above 5\/10 of the sign).<\/p>\n<p>Conceit affects all qualities directly or indirectly, as it shows exceeding presumption, easy promises at the time of euphoria, intrusiveness, apparent courage or courage in easy cases, according to Moretti\u2019s remark.<\/p>\n<p>The sign Rising, as already mentioned, does not imply a greater strength than Stable on the Line, as conceit (above 5\/10) or a disposition to improve (to 5\/10) are psychologically weaker than firmness because they are based on lack.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, conceit is nothing but a claim of the Ego to go beyond its real capacity, so that it becomes a foundationless, baseless strength; in the same way, disposition to improve contains a part of anxiety, just a pinch of worry to weaken the personality. (Att, 74)<br \/>\nConceit, moreover, by forcing feelings to be more than what they really are, pushes them to exhaustion.
