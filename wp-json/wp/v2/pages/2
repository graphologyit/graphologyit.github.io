Its overall theoretical framework is quite simple, based on readily understandable assumptions which point out the relation between psychic and graphical features; it can be applied under both clinical and everyday life conditions because it is an intriguing tool for gaining access to the basic inner structures of the individual psyche and its essential components: sentiment and intelligence. In this sense, it is not a therapeutic but a diagnostic tool. However, the opportunity to gain direct access to the personality&#8217;s inner core can be a therapeutic action whenever \u201cseeing\u201d a structure from the outside leads to an understanding of its dynamics, in an almost deterministic perspective; therefore, it lays the foundations for both self-reconciliation and reconciliation with others.<\/p>\n<p>To complete the volume over 250 samples of handwriting are presented, for educational purposes, many of which belong to characters who, in very different ways, have made their mark on politics (Hitler, Churchill, Obama), sciences (Newton, Darwin, Tesla), literature (Hemingway, Woolf, Buck), the arts (Picasso, Canova, Mozart) and religion (Pope John XXIII, Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Pope John Paul II).<\/p>\n<p>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">LIDIA FOGAROLO graduated in psychology and is specialised in graphology.

These two facets are both highly important in order to understand personality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Handwriting clearly represents a product both of adaptation (use of conventional signs) and expression (personal elaboration of graphic shapes).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Graphology\u2019s subject of study in is handwriting seen as an expressive behavior; this method is based on a psychological rule saying that every unconsciousor conscious psychic content must become manifest through some kind of expression: all expressive behavior forms are expression of the human being and his\/her distinctive features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Handwriting, as well as all forms of expressive behavior, is highly consistent and does not change much in a lifetime. However, among all the expressive behaviors, it is the richest in informations about personality found till nowadays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The spontaneous graphic movement reveals all about an individual, seen through criteria based on the two pillars of graphological interpretation: analogy and symbolism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Morettian graphology video lectures<\/h4>\n<p>Spoken language: Italian<\/p>\n<p>Subtitles: English<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vZxMlkaIRxM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Morettian graphology video lectures\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLKthmYZeI1TeuVbRi2JrtLX566xri6MgG\">(see more)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Lidia Fogarolo, Personality traits in handwriting, Chapter 7 \u2013 Rhythm<\/h4>\n<p>Why the movement creates development and psychological identity (October 2012)<\/p>\n<p>The first characteristic associated with life is without doubt movement: whether it is understood as development influenced by heredity or as learning due to a process of interaction with the environment, the process of individual maturation is closely linked to the personality&#8217;s ability to move &#8211; in both a physical and psychological sense &#8211; from one situation to another, from one level of understanding to a consequent level.<\/p>\n<p>Movement, understood as the ability to responds to what life puts in front of us, is an extremely complex individual characteristic, one that can be classified according to highly diverse quantitative and qualitative criteria that combine together to give life to what in graphology is called graphical rhythm. For example, the quantitative criteria that respond to the question &#8220;How fast is the movement?&#8221; require a qualitative definition able to specify whether the rapid movement is organised, or conversely impatient, unstable and unstructured. Therefore many evaluation criteria have to be integrated in order to identify the typology, structure and efficiency of the movement under analysis.

This is an instinctive disposition of sentiment which goes beyond reasoning, and is therefore implemented automatically. In contrast, the angular movement stems the tendency of sentiment to adhere entirely to the point of view of others because it employs snags (angles), that is to say more or less frequent and intense stopping points which prevent the Self from surrendering immediately. In this sense it is an indicator of egoism since it provides greater protection to the needs of the individual.
