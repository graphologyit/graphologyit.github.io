Therefore it allows to define the whole individual energy potential as a resultant of all the specific personality traits.<br \/>\nEvery graphological sign colours psyche in a certain way and determines a specific way of being, of seeing and interpreting the world in terms of thought and feelings; in this sense graphological analysis of personality allows behaviour prediction seen as a disposition to act according to the personal perception of reality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At the moment there are 8 lessons available on line (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9).<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a
