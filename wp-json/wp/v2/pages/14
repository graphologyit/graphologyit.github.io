This interior psychic whole acts in the sense it balances our conscious life, driving us to integrate repressed qualities. In this integration process interpersonal relations are crucial: other people continually offer us psychic qualities we wish to incorporate into ourselves, or on the contrary which provoke strong feelings of rejection in us. Each relationship, in which a certain emotional tone is present, is signalling to us those parts of us which require integration.<\/p>\n<p>In life we go through different phases. Sometimes we feel the need to strengthen our conscious personality, by surrounding ourselves with people who are like us, with which we establish a relationship based on reciprocal understanding. Occasionally we go through phases in which we need to totally re-question the conscious psychic values: the superior Self, in the Jungian sense, is at work in order to force the personality to broaden its limits. In this phase we are willing to be fascinated by someone and this phase, as we know from analytical psychology, is a state of mind which arises when we recognise, outside of ourselves, particular qualities that we are without, or, more precisely, that lie buried in our unconscious.<\/p>\n<p>This schematisation corresponds to two fundamental principles that govern personal interaction:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>the energy tends to balance itself, in other words opposites attract, in a psychic as well as physical sense. Often it is the differences, rather than the similarities, which make a relationship last, because the differences represent room for growth.<\/li>\n<li>The energy&#39;s schemata tend to be perpetuated: people with similar orientations support each other at a mental and physical level.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Moretti concisely expressed these concepts in the following terms: similarity serves to unite, diversity serves to attract.<\/p>\n<p>What we look for in ourselves is reflected in the choice of people we associate with: are we in a phase of strengthening our conscious psychic functions and therefore do we look for people similar to ourselves, or are we looking for something very different to ourselves, which frees us from the predictability that we have become bored of?<br \/> Individual graphological analysis referred to the handwriting of those people to whom we feel more attached to (firstly our partner) offers us important indications concerning the developmental tendencies taking place in the individual psyche. In our emotional choices we expose the most intimate, most vulnerable part of ourselves, and at the same time we show which direction our unconscious is driving us, which is the psychic dimension that is still unconscious and that requires conscious integration.<\/p>\n<p>Our fascination of others indicates which of our deficiencies we feel the need to make up by means of another person and throws a lot of light on our most profound tendencies: who we are, what we are looking for, and in which direction we are evolving.<br \/> The practical application of these concepts makes compatibility one of the most fascinating problems in graphology, because it sees the individual in his inner search and in his most authentic choices, in that they are fully unconscious, with sometimes surprising revelations as we shall see in the practical cases we study.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to the psychoanalyst Jung, each personality is the product of a partial development, which maintains a &#39;psychic whole&#39; only at the unconscious level.
