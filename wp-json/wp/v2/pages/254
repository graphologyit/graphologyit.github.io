Therefore, creative response is totally spontaneous.<\/p>\n<p>However, as already demonstrated, at a psychological level creativity is a highly complex function\u00a0 to be, first of all, allowed or authorized by the conscious Ego. That is, a personality structure capable of admitting not to have all answers and consequently tolerate uncertainty is necessary: in brief, the mind must be able to admit to have a problem, that is, to be in a crisis, when nothing is certain. This is a necessary prerequisite for new ideas to be born and therefore for the creative process to begin.<\/p>\n<p>However, the mere acknowledgment to ignore can be a stressor for the personality, which likes predictable and well-defined situations as symbols of safety, especially when a cognitive challenge is perceived as excessive.<br \/>\nAs it is well known, each personality will admit willingly to ignore, as long as it does not feel involved and affected by such admission the whole structure of the Ego or important parts of it.<br \/>\nIf the personality feels insecure, confused o attacked regarding what it believes at the core and highly important for its safety and vital for its image, it will set up impressive behaviors as a defence of the consolidated structures of the Ego, regarding the cognitive, emotional or \u201cvalue\u201d field as well. Therefore, it will tend to deny problems, both through remotion and selected perception of stimuli, preventing from getting inside those perceived as dangerous.<br \/>\nOn the contrary, a personality can easily admit a crisis and consequent creative questioning, whenever only partial facets of the Ego structure are involved; for instance, as an extreme example it is clear that it is much easier and also more entertaining to admit a crisis when solving a crossword puzzle than regarding the main values in our life. This to understand why it is not always easy to accept to be in a crisis, o to ignore; hence, such inability can inhibit just the first step, defined above as a prerequisite, which allows a creative process to flow.<br \/>\nMoving to the following step in questioning, now another difficult stage begins which can be obstructed by a set of wrong strategies employed by the personality, such as : making an excessive effort, using an attitude too focused on a specific result, increasing stress and anxiety are all counterproductive issues because they activate too highly focused behavioral strategies\u00a0 that destroy the overall view of a situation. Hence, they do not allow, specifically at a perceptional level, to grasp all the items in the observation field and subsequently do not allow the fine movement of suspension, while waiting all items join in a new structure.<br \/>\nEach time a personality lives in a situation of feeling threatened, criticized, stressed or under an exceeding pressure, it hardly uses subtle, intuitive ways, choosing instead tried and well-tested thinking methods, as &#8211; in appearance &#8211; they do not involve taking new risks. Such an answer can be extended in general to all situation the Ego perceives as critic and competitive and if such experiences last long they induce a visible writing automatism.<\/p>\n<p>When from a perceptional point of view a personality feels the world as a basically dangerous place, necessarily defensive, or at least precautionary behaviors increase, with a diminished openness to try new solutions. So that thinking moves to less creative and more conventional\u00a0 ways.<br \/>\nSummarizing, a personality can oppose a creative process:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>both by denying the problem, and, according to Popper, the problem starts the research process:<\/li>\n<li>and by stiffening the mental process, subordinating it to a goal-oriented volitive behavior, while the intuitive and creative process takes place according to an effortless movement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>From a graphological point of view, as the combination necessary to the sign Methodically Uneven is tightly related to creative and intuitive thinking, of course a personality highly stressed does not allow itself such free movement, but seeks for precise, clear solutions, forever true. So, it chooses what is defined by psychologists a dogmatic behavior, as a consequence of the personality stiffening because afraid of losing control of the self and\/or environment all around the self and therefore it follows external (and internal) rules, set once and for all, to be applied to all situations. Just the personality outlined by the sign Even originated by a defensive reactive formation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As already said above, intuitive thinking activates automatically in presence of a situation perceived as problematic.
