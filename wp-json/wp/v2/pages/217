It implies the creation of a division inside the Ego in order to separate the bright side from the earthly, dark side by setting quite well-defined borders: it requires a hard selection. From a psychological point of view, it is a process requiring a strong personality, very well structured, capable of a clear mental vision and of resisting temptations, that is, resisting the appeal of the repudiated parts.<\/p>\n<p>The other path is based on an opposite view, devoiding of any value the idea of selection and separation, as activities belonging to the Ego, therefore, unsuitable to a spiritual path. This because all that reinforces the Ego &#8211; or the personality &#8211; makes a sharply cut separation between an individual and the whole he is immersed in, consequently a separation full of anguish and also source of subsequent guilty feelings.<\/p>\n<p>In different words, this separation is enhanced by reinforcing the borders, thus increasing fear: both feelings don not make it easier to connect to the numinous whereas all is included in the \u201ctranscendent\u201d concept &#8211; according to its second meaning &#8211; revolves around the concept of an Ego capable of giving up its own borders and of immersing itself into a real &#8211; not fantastic &#8211; world which transcends such borders.<\/p>\n<p>These two paths not only diverge about the ways necessary to the same purpose, but also about the different personality structures needed in order to follow them at the best: a very well-structured and selective Ego is necessary to the Ego-opposing path, as a personality must be mentally articulated and defence-oriented; on the contrary, the second path requires a personality full of leaks and openings inside its very structure, in order to allow \u201cother\u201d experiences to pass through. This implies personality features which can weaken the Ego borders.<\/p>\n<p>The graphological signs allowing us to detect this process of opening\/weakening of the personality structure borders can be quite a few, as each one offers a different contribution; for instance, Curved, because of its proneness to connection, Forward Slant, because of abandon, Right Bent Extensions, because of surrendering, Wide between Letters, for unselfishness, Top Openings A-O for sensuality, Filiform, for its subtle sensitivity.<\/p>\n<p>Approaching now Swami Rama and Padre Pio, from a graphological point of view we face two personalities who somehow impersonate &#8211; at the extreme &#8211; the previously analyzed two ways to mysticism and, contradicting all those &#8211; like the writer &#8211; who believe the equation \u201cEastern- personality very little structured in a defensive sense\u201d (and Western as its contrary), here we find a real capsizing of the commonplace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seeking the Unknowable By extreme simplification, we can say two ways exist to understand the human path to God: one comes from opposing to the Ego, seen as the enemy to conquer-therefore, much of the path to holiness consists of trying to transcend what is often hated and despised for its weakness.
