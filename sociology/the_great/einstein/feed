					<description><![CDATA[[...] http://www.graphology.it/sociology/the_great/einstein There is quite a lot things in this that I do not fully understand, however, reading it is seems he married a women who was also a scientist, which he told his mother would be good because they could work together (which was very far from being a traditional life at this time) but when they were together, Einstein basically made her take on the role of a housewife. Their first child (a son) was born out-of-wedlock (again very unusual) and then this was followed by a baby girl.  From what I can understand, it seems Einstein did not feel much love for any of them, and from this, the children turned against him, and showed him no love either. Him and his wife Mileva Maric had another child, another boy who shared his farther&#8217;s intelligence, but it seems from what I can grasp that the relationship was very strained because although the son was intelligent he was also highly emotional. This meant Einstein could not even really stand the sight of his son. In fact the son Eduard ended up in a mental institution which Einstein never visited. One side of the story behind this is that he did not want to upset his son by visiting as he knew it would only make matters worse- the other opinion is that Einstein was simply self-centred and cruel.
