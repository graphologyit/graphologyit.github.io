He creates intense emotional bonds which are at the same time very binding for the individual&#39;s freedom. Furthermore it limits the possibility for the creative expression of the individual&#39;s uniqueness in that attention is constantly directed externally; on the other hand it facilitates the assimilation of external contents.<br \/> The contradiction between the two different attitudes poses interesting cultural questions: it is evident that the Upright sign, as an expression of the individual&#39;s centring on himself, expresses the cultural aspect which is more consistent with the needs of highly individualistic modern societies. Educational pressures, for example, appear increasingly more intense so that the child shows itself &#39;autonomous&#39; from an early age. While the Forward Slant sign seems a psychological characteristic which is more consistent with societies in the past, in that, by favouring bonds of association and fusion not only between individuals, but also between the individual and the environment, it stirs the tendency for the individual to identify with the cultural group to which he belongs, limiting at the same time the individual&#39;s creativity. On this point Moretti already noted that the Upright sign &quot;more than anything is intentional, because handwriting by its nature should slant to the right. However, those who write with upright handwriting are inclined to adopt it and this needs to be considered.&quot; (Moretti, 1945, p. 98)<br \/> In Morettian graphology the third movement given by the slant to the left (Backward Slant sign) is not a direct tendency, but it arises as a concealment of the initial tendency to slant to the right. The subject considers it too dangerous to show his need for others and an reversed cover mechanism is implemented: the attention and the need to relate are pursued and implemented through mechanisms of contradiction and spitefulness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Graphic slant, that is the relationship between the axes of the letters and the real or presumed base line, is a form of analogical language which has a strong visual impact and rarely goes unnoticed: handwriting can be upright, that is perpendicular to the base line, or slant to the right or to the left.
