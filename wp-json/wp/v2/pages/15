The latter can also be experienced by the Self as inner contradictions, in that they originated from the interference of signs that do not belong to the dominant temperament.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense we can assert that the beauty of a personality is given by the harmonious play of the individual components that are organised around a central convergent nucleus (dominant temperament), but enriched by different presences, that make the personality less obvious, less predictable. A resistant temperament, for example, can contain within itself unexpected elements of opening (a sign of surrender), like a surrendering temperament can contain inside itself elements of inner resistance which are not entirely visible at first.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are some handwritings in which one notes that a single sign dominates the handwriting to such an extent as to reveal a cumbersome presence which entirely dominates within the personality and attracts other signs of disequilibrium to itself, in the absence of any compensatory or balancing drive.<\/p>\n<p>The result is that the handwriting immediately appears marked by a specific graphological sign, with a perceptive obviousness that immediately transmits the psyche suffering due to the disequilibrium of that single sign, which appears like a flashing light to draw attention to itself: the personality has lost the ability to balance itself, something in the psychic life of the subject is completely out of control and it is noticeably indicated.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Morettian method is based on the recognition of the energetic contributions of the individual graphological signs (the psyche&#39;s qualities) and on the interaction that occurs between the signs themselves, in order to recognise the tendencies that strengthen reciprocally (convergent signs) and the tendencies that complete each other.
