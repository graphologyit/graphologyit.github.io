(Moretti, 1974, p. 276)<br \/> In second place, we must consider the psychological meaning of the eccentricity, the tendency to contradiction, the difficulty to surrender in that this; &quot;principally indicates strange daydreams, founded on a contorted egoistic sentiment, in that it proceeds with the inferior vertex, preserving the superior vertex that is introduced after the inferior vertex has overcome the process obstacles.&quot; (Moretti, 1962, p. 127) The need to be at the centre of other people&#39;s attention in order to satisfy the emotional sentiment is cultivated with methods belonging to the spirit of contradiction and the tendency to spitefulness. &quot;In sensuality it has something of frigidity in its methods and mainly for the difficulty of surrendering.&quot; (Moretti, 1972, p. 331) It gives an affection directed by suspicion, from which arises the contradiction between the need for emotional abandon, belonging to the Forward Slant sign, and the lack of trust in abandonment itself, belonging to the Backward Slant sign. These two tendencies in open opposition create very strong interior conflicts of an emotional nature. The emotional sentiment of those who have the Backward Slant writing must daily live with the contradiction between the two opposing tendencies, which feeds the jealousies, the exaggerated possessive needs because they are based on a sense of interior insecurity, the suspicions that arise in the mind of those who always doubt the other.<br \/> In contexts of contradiction exaggerated or supported by other signs, Backward Slant leads to the temptation to commit suicide as an expression of the intensity of internal suffering and as a form of spite and extreme contradiction towards the person loved.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Backward Slant writing is that which slants to the reader&#39;s left.
