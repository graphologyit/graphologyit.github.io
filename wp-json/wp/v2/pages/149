However, he surely possessed the charismatic leader\u2019s charm, because he could draw about himself an ever-increasing number of physicians rather quickly.<br \/>\nBy the spreading of Freudian theories and the expanding of the fundamentals of interpretation, psychoanalysis actually had become a global initiation approach to life, changing into an almost eschatological vision of salvation.<br \/>\nThe following rejection of this part of the Freudian thought makes us sometimes forget what this different approach to mental diseases meant to the physicians of the time; what a hope it could be for psychiatrists, confined as well as their patients in the most disquieting halls of the mental hospitals of the time, to admit that mental disease could possess its own logic, which could be understandable, and could, moreover, be explained on the basis of psychodynamic factors, such as, for instance, the removal of traumatic memories. In lieu of a strait-jacket, dialogue.<br \/>\nFreud precisely distinguished among several processes the human mind operates by in the field of defensive mechanisms: negation, by which parts of our mind can be removed and completely erased from our conscience, and projection, which implies the presence of removed contents, although perceived as external to our psyche.<br \/>\nBy discovering this process that belongs to the human mind, he could set up the cultural bases on which mental diseases had become a ground for exploration, through the unveiling of a symbolic language performed by a rational mind.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s our view of man that changed along with the demonstration of what seems (according to its own term logic) by itself, indemonstrable: the existence of an unconscious part of the human psyche you can indirectly get back to &#8211; through dreams as well &#8211; which reminds us we don\u2019t rule our home, as awareness is the lighthouse enlightening just a slightest part of mental processes.<br \/>\nAll that remains is a mysterious world to be explored, crossed, understood and, partly, brought back to light. If not understood, it operates blindly; if understood, it can take in some kind of mediation.<br \/>\nIt is clear that this land is so disquieting and unfriendly by itself, because everybody knows he has his inner ghosts, which need to be known only to be overstepped.<br \/>\nHowever, who can state that afterwards it will be possible to get back without being overwhelmed by our dark side itself, come to resonance with the Other\u2019s shadow?<br \/>\nEverybody working with diseases knows that there is a limit beyond which getting in touch with the others\u2019 weakness, in the form of a physical or psychic disease, recalls our inner weakness. And especially speaking about Freud, we realize that in addiction to being an explorer in an utterly unknown land (the unhealthy human psyche) and very dangerous too, he dared to venture in a field considered very unseemly from a social point of view (unconscious, sexuality), still willing to keep the full dignity of his profession as a neurologist, to gain recognition in the scientific field, objective and demonstrable, and surely not to be mistaken for a quack.<br \/>\nFrom a graphological point of view, there is an obvious interest in showing the personality resources which supported Freud in facing such a disturbing situation, not only without being personally devastated, but, on the contrary, creating about himself the great cultural ferment which gave way to psychoanalysis.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>THE POWER OF A SHARP MIND Apparently, some people are devoted to hopeless causes.
